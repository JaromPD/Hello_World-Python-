# Overview

hello_world-Python- is a simple program that takes a user message as an input, and then uses the
print() function to print that message.

The purpose of this project was to expierement with creating simple Python code, and to expierement
with creating Git and GitHub repositories. My hope was to get practice with small simple code projects
before moving on to more complicated things.
